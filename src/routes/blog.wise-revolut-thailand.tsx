      <p>
        Wise and Revolut are the two most commonly recommended travel cards for Thailand — and for good reason. Both eliminate the foreign transaction fees and international ATM charges that make standard bank cards so expensive abroad. But they work differently, and the better choice depends on how you travel and how much cash you typically withdraw.

      <h2>Exchange rate: Wise wins on transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Wise uses the <strong>mid-market exchange rate</strong> — the rate you see on Google or XE.com — with no markup, at all times. This is the most transparent rate available and means you always know exactly what you're paying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revolut also uses a rate close to the interbank rate on weekdays, which is very competitive. However, on <strong>weekends and public holidays</strong>, Revolut adds a 1% markup to account for market volatility. If you are exchanging or withdrawing on a Saturday or Sunday, Wise is slightly cheaper.
      </p>

      <h2>ATM withdrawals: depends on how much cash you need</h2>
      <p>
        Both cards charge no home-bank ATM fee within their free monthly allowances. The Thai bank's flat fee (250 THB for Visa) still applies regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wise</strong> gives you two free withdrawals per month up to approximately $1,400 USD equivalent — generous enough for most trips to Thailand. After that, a fee of around 1.75% applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Revolut Standard</strong> gives you a free allowance of approximately $300 USD equivalent per month. For a two-week trip where you withdraw ฿20,000 (~$570 USD) per transaction, you will exceed the free tier quickly. The 2% fee on the excess is modest but adds up.
      </p>
      <div className="callout">
        <p><strong>For most Thailand trips:</strong> Wise's free ATM allowance is sufficient for the entire trip. Revolut Standard's free tier may run out after one or two withdrawals, depending on your home currency and the current exchange rate.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Practical usability in Thailand</h2>
      <p>
        Both cards are widely accepted at Thai ATMs. Visa cards are preferred over Mastercard at Thai ATMs because the flat fee is lower (250 THB vs 350 THB). Wise issues Visa cards in most markets. Revolut issues either Visa or Mastercard depending on your country — check which you have before you travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both apps work well in Thailand and allow you to freeze/unfreeze your card, view transactions in real time, and set spending limits. Mobile data is required for app functionality — a Thai SIM card or international roaming plan is recommended.
      </p>

      <h2>Which should you choose?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose Wise if:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You plan to withdraw more than $300 USD equivalent in cash during your trip.</li>
        <li>You want the most transparent exchange rate with no weekend markup.</li>
        <li>You prefer a straightforward, no-subscription product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose Revolut if:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You primarily use cards for payments rather than ATM withdrawals, keeping cash use minimal.</li>
        <li>You already have a Revolut account and your cash needs fit within the free tier.</li>
        <li>You want additional features like travel insurance or lounge access (paid plans).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Best approach for most travellers:</strong> carry both. They are both free to open and maintain on the standard plan. Use Wise for ATM withdrawals and Revolut for card payments where contactless is accepted.
      </p>

      <h2>What neither card can avoid</h2>
      <p>
        Both Wise and Revolut still require you to pay the Thai bank's displayed foreign-card ATM fee. At many major bank ATMs, the common split is 250 THB for Visa and 350 THB for Mastercard. Neither card generally reimburses this operator fee.
