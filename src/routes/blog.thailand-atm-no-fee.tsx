        The honest answer is: you cannot completely avoid ATM fees in Thailand. For a full breakdown of what each fee is and who charges it, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-fees">Thailand ATM fees explained</a>. For a direct comparison of the two most popular travel cards, see <a href="/blog/wise-revolut-thailand">Wise vs Revolut for Thailand</a>. The Thai bank that owns the ATM will always charge a flat fee on foreign card withdrawals — currently 250 THB for Visa cards and 350 THB for Mastercard. That fee goes to the Thai bank and there is no way around it with a standard debit or credit card.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you <em>can</em> eliminate are the fees charged by your home bank — the foreign transaction percentage, the international ATM fee, and the exchange rate markup. With the right card, those charges drop to zero, leaving you paying only the unavoidable Thai ATM flat fee.

      <h2>Best cards for minimising fees in Thailand</h2>

      <h3>Wise (formerly TransferWise)</h3>
      <p>
        Wise is widely considered the best option for ATM withdrawals in Thailand. It uses the mid-market exchange rate with no markup, charges no foreign transaction fee, and offers two free ATM withdrawals per month (up to ~$1,400 USD equivalent). After the free allowance, a small fee applies. The only cost you cannot avoid is the Thai bank's flat fee.
      </p>

      <h3>Revolut</h3>
      <p>
        Revolut Standard offers fee-free ATM withdrawals up to ~$300 USD equivalent per month, after which a 2% fee applies. Premium and Metal plans have higher limits. Like Wise, Revolut uses the interbank exchange rate during market hours, with a small weekend markup. A solid option if you keep withdrawals within the free tier.
      </p>

      <h3>Charles Schwab (US travellers)</h3>
      <p>
        The Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking account reimburses all ATM fees worldwide — including the Thai bank's flat fee — at the end of each month. For US-based travellers, this is the closest you can get to genuinely fee-free withdrawals in Thailand. The account requires a linked brokerage account but has no minimum balance.
      </p>

      <h3>Starling Bank (UK travellers)</h3>
      <p>
        Starling charges no foreign transaction fees and no international ATM fees. It uses the Mastercard exchange rate, which is close to the mid-market rate. The Thai ATM flat fee still applies, but your home bank adds nothing on top.
      </p>

      <h3>Halifax Clarity (UK travellers)</h3>
      <p>
        The Halifax Clarity credit card has no foreign transaction fees and no ATM fees abroad. Note that cash advances on credit cards typically accrue interest immediately — pay off the balance the same day to avoid interest charges.
      </p>

      <div className="callout-tip">
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you already have a Wise or Revolut account, make sure you load it with your home currency before you travel. Converting at home (or in the app) gives you more control over the rate than converting at the ATM.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Do not rely on historical low-fee ATM claims</h2>
      <p>
        Even with a fee-free card, you will usually pay the Thai ATM's displayed foreign-card fee. Older Thailand travel guides sometimes mention a lower AEON fee, but we cannot verify a current foreign-card AEON ATM network or locations. Treat any historical low-fee claim with caution and use the amount shown on the ATM screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more dependable way to lower costs is to use a card with low overseas fees, make fewer transactions when it is safe to do so, and decline DCC by choosing Thai Baht.
      </p>

      <h2>Always decline DCC</h2>
      <p>
        When the ATM asks whether you want to pay in your home currency or Thai Baht, always choose <strong>Thai Baht</strong>. The ATM's own conversion rate (dynamic currency conversion, or DCC) is typically 3–7% worse than the rate applied by your card network. On a ฿10,000 withdrawal, that difference can be $10–20.
      </p>
      <p>
        This single habit — declining DCC every time — is the most impactful thing most tourists can do to reduce their ATM costs in Thailand.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary: the lowest-cost withdrawal strategy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a fee-free travel card (Wise, Revolut, Schwab, Starling).</li>
        <li>Check the fee displayed by the ATM and use the calculator override if it differs from the default.</li>
        <li>Withdraw the maximum amount per transaction that is sensible and safe, to minimise the number of flat fees paid.</li>
        <li>Always choose Thai Baht — do not accept the ATM’s conversion offer.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Following these steps can reduce the avoidable parts of your withdrawal cost, but the final result still depends on your card terms, the displayed Thai ATM fee, and the live rate. Use the calculator to compare your actual card and intended withdrawal amount before you confirm.
