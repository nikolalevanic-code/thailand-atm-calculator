        Thailand is increasingly card-friendly, but cash remains essential in many situations — especially outside Bangkok. Knowing roughly how much you'll need helps you plan your ATM withdrawals efficiently and avoid paying unnecessary fees on small, frequent withdrawals. For guidance on minimising ATM fees when you withdraw, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-fees">Thailand ATM fees explained</a> and <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-no-fee">how to withdraw money in Thailand without fees</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you need cash in Thailand</h2>
      <p>
        Card acceptance has improved significantly in Thailand over the past few years, particularly in Bangkok and major tourist areas. However, cash is still required or strongly preferred in many common situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Street food and local markets</strong> — almost always cash only.</li>
        <li><strong>Tuk-tuks, motorbike taxis, and songthaews</strong> — cash only.</li>
        <li><strong>Temple entrance fees</strong> — cash only.</li>
        <li><strong>Smaller guesthouses and bungalows</strong> — often cash only, especially on islands.</li>
        <li><strong>Island transport</strong> (ferries, longtail boats) — usually cash.</li>
        <li><strong>Massage shops</strong> — many smaller ones are cash only.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxi meters</strong> — technically accept cards via apps, but drivers often prefer cash.</li>
        <li><strong>National parks</strong> — entrance fees are cash only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cards (Visa/Mastercard) are reliably accepted at 7-Eleven, major supermarkets, shopping malls, hotel restaurants, and most mid-range and upscale restaurants in Bangkok and tourist centres.
      </p>

        <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Budget for slightly more than you think you'll need. Running out of cash on an island or in a rural area can be inconvenient — ATMs are not always nearby, and some machines run out of notes during peak season.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Should you bring cash from home or withdraw in Thailand?</h2>
      <p>
        For most travellers, <strong>withdrawing from ATMs in Thailand is the better option</strong>. The exchange rates at Thai ATMs (via Visa/Mastercard networks) are typically better than those offered by airport currency exchange desks or high-street banks in your home country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exception is if you have access to a genuinely competitive exchange rate at home — for example, through a Superrich branch in Bangkok (if you're already there), or a specialist currency exchange service in your home city that offers rates close to the mid-market rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid airport exchange desks</strong> in both your home country and Thailand. The rates are consistently poor, and the convenience premium is not worth it.
      </p>

      <h2>How to minimise ATM fees on your withdrawals</h2>
      <p>
        Since Thai ATMs charge a flat fee per transaction (250 THB for Visa, 350 THB for Mastercard), the most efficient strategy is to withdraw larger amounts less frequently. Rather than withdrawing ฿3,000 every day, withdraw ฿15,000–20,000 every few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined with a fee-free travel card (Wise, Revolut, Starling, Charles Schwab), this approach minimises the total cost of accessing cash in Thailand. See our guide on <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-no-fee">how to withdraw money in Thailand without fees</a> for the full breakdown.
      </p>

      <h2>A note on carrying large amounts of cash</h2>
      <p>
        Thailand is generally safe for tourists, but carrying large amounts of cash increases risk. Practical precautions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a money belt or hidden pouch for larger amounts.</li>
        <li>Keep daily spending money separate from your reserve.</li>
        <li>Most mid-range and upscale hotels have in-room safes.</li>
        <li>Withdraw what you need for 2–3 days at a time rather than a full week's worth at once.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Most travellers to Thailand need between <strong>500–2,000 THB per day</strong> in cash, depending on travel style and destination. Withdraw from ATMs in Thailand rather than exchanging at home, use a fee-free card to eliminate home-bank charges, and withdraw larger amounts less frequently to minimise flat fees.
