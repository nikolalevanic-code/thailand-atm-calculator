        Thailand has some of the most restrictive ATM withdrawal limits in Southeast Asia. For a full breakdown of the fees charged per transaction, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-fees">Thailand ATM fees explained</a>. To minimise the cost of multiple withdrawals, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-no-fee">how to withdraw money in Thailand without fees</a>. Most machines cap each transaction at 20,000 THB, and some banks impose additional daily limits on foreign cards. If you need a larger amount of cash — for a hotel deposit, a motorbike rental, or a longer stay — understanding these limits in advance will save you time and unnecessary fees.

      <h2>Per-transaction limits by Thai bank</h2>
      <p>
        The per-transaction limit is the maximum you can withdraw in a single ATM session. This is set by the Thai bank that owns the ATM, not by your home bank.

      <h2>Your home bank's daily limit</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the Thai ATM's per-transaction cap, your own bank will have a daily withdrawal limit for international ATM use. This is separate from the Thai bank's limit and is set by your card issuer. Common limits:

        Check with your bank before you travel. Some banks allow you to temporarily raise your international ATM limit if you notify them in advance.
      </p>

      <h2>The fee implication of multiple transactions</h2>
      <p>
        Because Thai ATMs charge a flat fee per transaction (250 THB for Visa, 350 THB for Mastercard), the number of withdrawals you make has a direct impact on your total cost. If you need ฿40,000 and the ATM limits you to ฿20,000 per transaction, you will pay the flat fee twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why <strong>withdrawing the maximum amount per transaction</strong> is almost always the most cost-efficient strategy — assuming you have a safe place to store the cash.
      </p>
      <div className="callout-tip">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Withdrawing ฿20,000 twice costs 500 THB in Thai ATM fees (Visa). Withdrawing ฿10,000 four times costs 1,000 THB. Same cash, double the fees.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What to do if you need more than 20,000 THB at once</h2>
      <p>
        If you need a large amount of cash — for a long-term rental deposit, a tour package, or similar — there are a few options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make multiple ATM withdrawals</strong> across different machines or at different times of day (some banks reset transaction counts at midnight).</li>
        <li><strong>Use a bank branch</strong> — you can often withdraw larger amounts over the counter at a Thai bank branch with your foreign card and passport, though fees may differ.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a currency exchange booth</strong> (Superrich, Vasu Exchange) — for large amounts, the exchange rate at a reputable money changer in Bangkok can be better than the ATM rate, with no flat fee. This requires bringing foreign cash from home.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank transfer</strong> — for very large amounts (property deposits, long-term rentals), a SWIFT transfer to a Thai bank account is often the most cost-effective route.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Most Thai ATMs limit foreign card withdrawals to <strong>20,000 THB per transaction</strong>. Your home bank may impose an additional daily limit. To minimise fees, make fewer larger withdrawals when it is safe, check the displayed ATM fee, and use the card network that gives you the lower displayed fee.
