        The most useful Thai ATM is usually the one that accepts your card, displays a fee you understand, and lets you decline currency conversion. For a full breakdown of all fee types, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-fees">Thailand ATM fees explained</a>. To see which travel cards can reduce home-bank charges, see <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-no-fee">how to withdraw money in Thailand without fees</a>. At many major Thai bank ATMs, foreign-card fees are 250 THB for Visa or 350 THB for Mastercard; check the screen before confirming because fees and limits can change.

      <h2>Choose a reliable ATM, then check the screen</h2>
      <p>
        Large Thai bank networks such as Bangkok Bank, KBank, SCB, Krungthai, and Krungsri are widely available and are practical choices for many visitors. Before you confirm a withdrawal, check three things displayed by the ATM: the foreign-card access fee, the per-transaction withdrawal limit, and whether the ATM is offering to convert the withdrawal into your home currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older Thailand travel guides often mention a lower AEON foreign-card fee. We cannot verify a current AEON foreign-card ATM network or locations, and there is evidence of phased AEON ATM-service termination in 2024. Do not plan a cash strategy around historical AEON fee claims; use the fee shown at the ATM and adjust the calculator setting if it differs from the default.
      </p>
      <div className="callout-tip">
        <p><strong>Best practical rule:</strong> choose Thai Baht if the ATM asks about conversion, and withdraw an amount that reduces the number of separate transactions without exceeding your budget or safe-cash limit.</p>

      <h2>Does the ATM brand matter beyond the fee?</h2>
      <p>
        For most foreign cardholders, the two meaningful differences are the displayed flat fee and withdrawal limit. If you decline DCC, your card network normally converts the transaction, rather than the ATM operator. The rate can still vary by card network and issuer, which is why your card selection matters in the calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
        One practical consideration is <strong>ATM availability and reliability</strong>. Major bank machines are widely distributed, but individual ATMs can have different limits, card-network support, or temporary faults. If a machine declines your card, try another major bank ATM rather than repeatedly retrying the same machine.
      </p>

      <h2>What about airport ATMs?</h2>
      <p>
        ATMs at Suvarnabhumi (BKK) and Don Mueang (DMK) airports are operated by the same Thai banks and charge the same fees. There is no airport surcharge beyond the standard 250–350 THB. However, airport ATMs are often the first machines tourists encounter, and they are particularly aggressive about offering DCC — the screen prompting you to pay in your home currency can be confusing. Always select Thai Baht.
      </p>
      <div className="callout">
        <p><strong>Avoid currency exchange desks at the airport.</strong> The rates offered by SuperRich and other exchange booths inside the airport are significantly worse than those at their city-centre branches. If you need cash immediately on arrival, use an ATM — then exchange at a city branch if you need more.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The card matters as much as the ATM</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing a practical ATM helps, but your home bank's charges — the foreign-transaction percentage and international ATM fee — can be just as important as the Thai bank's flat fee. A travel-focused card may reduce those home-bank charges; check the card’s current terms and use the calculator to compare your selected card.
      </p>
      <p>
        A practical low-cost combination is: <strong>a card with low overseas fees + fewer, larger withdrawals + always choosing Thai Baht</strong>. See our guide on <a href="/blog/thailand-atm-no-fee">how to withdraw money in Thailand without fees</a> for the full strategy.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        For foreign cards, start with a reliable major-bank ATM and check the fee and limit displayed on screen. At many such ATMs, Visa costs 250 THB and Mastercard costs 350 THB. To reduce the total cost, use a card with low overseas fees, withdraw efficiently, and always decline DCC by choosing Thai Baht.
